\section{Introduction}



\section{Related work}

In this section we present an overview of the technique used for fire rendering and inverse rendering problems.
A more detailed discussion of fire modelling, simulation and rendering is given in~\cite{Huang:2014}.

\subsection{Fire rendering}

Many methods have been proposed to render participating media realistically; typically, approximate solutions for the Radiative Transport Equation (RTE)~\cite{Howell:2002} are computed.
\cite{Rushmeier:1995} presented a method to perform accurate ray casting on sparse measured data.
The fire was modelled as a series of stacked cylindrical rings, where each ring has uniform properties.
%The total radiance at each point is integrated using a Monte Carlo method, summing up the measured irradiances at sample locations.
A technique to animate fire with suspended particles was introduced by~\cite{Feldman:2003}.
Emitted light was computed using Planck's formula of black body radiation their animation of fire with, however their RGB mapping requires a manual adjustment using images of real explosions.
%Direct illumination shadows were computed using deep shadow maps~\cite{Lokovic:2000}, while scattering and illumination by other objects in the scene used the technique proposed by~\cite{Jensen:2002}.
\cite{Nguyen:2002} proposed a ray marching technique using black body radiation as well, scattering in the media and the observer's visual adaptation to the fire are modelled.
An extension was presented by~\cite{Pegoraro:2006}, the authors' model has physically-based absorption, emission and scattering properties.
The spectroscopic characteristics of different fuels are achieved by modelling the transitions of electrons between different energy states in the molecules.
The method allows for non-linear light trajectories  in the medium due to refraction and it includes visual adaptation effects by means of a post-processing mechanism.
\cite{Horvath:2009} proposed a rendering method whose main objective was user-friendliness for artists.
The authors perform simple volume rendering on several fixed camera slices to generate an image.
Black body radiation is used to compute light emission; the images were motion-blurred with a filter based on the velocities in the slices, and heat distortion was added as post-processing filter defined by the user.

Rendering flames at interactive frame rates has also been explored, this techniques inevitably sacrifice quality for performance.
\cite{Bridault:2006} used a spectrophotometer to capture photometric distributions of candles.
The intensities are stored on a texture and changes in illumination over time are approximated with an attenuation factor proportional to the size of the flame.
\cite{Zhang:2011} used a plane blending technique were a one-dimensional colour texture is used as a transfer function to convert flow attributes to colours and opacities. 
A texture synthesis technique to generate fire animations was introduced by~\cite{Jamriska:2015}.
The method requires a hand made motion field and an alpha mask of the desired result, both of which are used to generate a new sequence using data from an existing video exemplar.
